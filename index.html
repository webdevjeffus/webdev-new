        <p>My name is Jeff George. I'm an independent full-stack web developer working out of New York City, NY. I'm actively seeking interesting full-time, contract or freelance opportunities in web development.</p>

        <p>I graduated from the <a href="https://devbootcamp.com" target="_blank" title="Explore Dev Bootcamp">Dev Bootcamp</a> web development immersive program in 2016. In about five months of incredibly intense work and study, my DBC classmates and I became full-stack web developers, skilled in a wide array of languages, libraries and tools. But even more important, we learned to learn new technology efficiently and effectively, and become able to apply it meaningfully in hours or days, rather than weeks or months. DBC's program also includes <a href="https://devbootcamp.com/blog/2013-06-24-why-empathy-is-at-the-heart-of-the-dbc-experience" target="_blank" title="Learn about DBC's innovative Engineering Empathy program">Engineering Empathy</a>, which covers "soft-skill" topics ranging from self-awareness to group dynamics, from communication to diversity. Software development is a team sport, and DBC grads are well-prepared to be effective team players.</p>

        <p>Since Dev Bootcamp, I've worked on a variety of independent, contract, and personal projects, and have continued to expand my web dev skill set. Many of these projects can be found in the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/work/" title="Check out my web dev portfolio">Work</a> section of this website, and more will be added in the days and weeks to come.</p>

        <p>In my career before Dev Bootcamp, I worked as a teacher, a photographer, a writer and editor, and even as a game designer. Throughout my career, though, all of my work has revolved around effective communication and creative problem-solving, and I'm excited to bring that background to the internet as a web developer.</p>

        <h3>About this website</h3>
        <p>This current version of my professional website is maintained using the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" title="Use Jekyll to manage your website">Jekyll static-site generator</a>, which automates the assembly of each page in the site based on templates and content I have created specifically for this site. Jekyll uses the <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki" target="_blank" title="Explore the Liquid repo at Github">Liquid scripting language</a> to bring programming concepts such as flow control, variables, and collections into HTML. You can explore <a href="https://github.com/webdevjeffus/webdev-new" target="_blank" title="The source code for webdevjeff.us">this site's unprocessed Jekyll source code</a> in a repo on my public Github account.</p>
        <p>The general design and basic styling for the site is provided by <a href="https://github.com/webdevjeffus/drop-in-css" target="_blank" title="Instantly style your semantic HTML with Drop-in.css">drop-in.css</a>, a robust stylesheet I created that instantly styles any web app with a single line of HTML code. The particular look for this site comes from <a href="https://github.com/webdevjeffus/drop-in-css/blob/master/docs/themes.md#whiteboard" target="_blank" title="Whiteboard theme for Drop-in.css">drop-in's Whiteboard theme</a>, which I created for this website. The responsive functionality of the site comes from <a href="https://github.com/webdevjeffus/griddy" target="_blank" title="Make your site responsive with griddy.css">griddy.css</a>, a lean, simple, mobile-first grid system that I developed to avoid the overhead and cookie-cutter look of a framework like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" title="Get Bootstrap at getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank" title="Download Foundation by Zurb">Foundation</a>. You can learn more about these tools at <a href="https://github.com/webdevjeffus" target="_blank" title="See drop-in.css, griddy.css, and more of my web dev work">my Github account</a>, and I will blog about how they are used in this website soon.</p>
        <p>The original concept for the site began with a mood board, followed by mock-ups prepared using the <a href="https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/" target="_blank" title="Learn about Mockups 3">Balsamiq Mockups 3</a> wireframing package. Images were prepared using <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank" title="Download the GNU Image Manipulation Program">GIMP</a>, a powerful open-source alternative to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank" title="Photoshop, everyone's default image editor">Adobe Photoshop</a>. Fonts include Permanent Marker (banner headings), Walter Turncoat (sub-headings), and Open Sans (body text), which are all served by <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" title="Free-to-use web fonts from Google">Google Fonts</a>. Many icons, including social media buttons, are displayed using <a href="http://fontawesome.io" target="_blank" title="Font Awesome by Dave Gandy">Font Awesome</a>.</p>
