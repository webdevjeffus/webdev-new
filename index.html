      <h1>Jeff George, <span class="no-break">Web Developer</span></h1>
      <p>Welcome to the portfolio and blog of Jeff George, an independent full-stack web developer working out of New York City, NY.</p>
      <p>This page is a work in progress. It is being developed using the Jekyll static site generator, along with my own <strong>drop-in.css</strong> stylesheet and <strong>griddy</strong> responsive grid system. When complete, it will replace my existing, vanilla HTML/CSS website at <a href="www.webdevjeff.us">webdevjeff.us</a>.</p>
