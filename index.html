        <p>Now that every computer user has accounts with dozens of online services, and each account has many files with megabytes of data, it's hard not to be overwhelmed by the amount of data developers have to deal with. We need a way to think about it that our brains can comprehend. That way is big-O notation&hellip;</p>

Tying these objects and methods together are special object categories, called classes. Every object belongs to some class&hellip;</p>

      <p>Welcome to the portfolio and blog of Jeff George, an independent full-stack web developer working out of New York City, NY.</p>
      <p>This site is a work in progress. It is being developed using the Jekyll static site generator, along with my own <strong>drop-in.css</strong> stylesheet and <strong>griddy</strong> responsive grid system. When complete, it will replace my existing, vanilla HTML/CSS website at <a href="www.webdevjeff.us">webdevjeff.us</a>.</p>
