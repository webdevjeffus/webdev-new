# Jeff George, Web Developer
Welcome to the portfolio and blog of Jeff George, an independent full-stack web developer working out of New York City, NY.

This page is a work in progress. It is being developed using the Jekyll web server format, along with my own **drop-in.css** stylesheet and **griddy** responsive grid system. When complete, it will replace my existing, vanilla HTML/CSS website at <a href="www.webdevjeff.us">webdevjeff.us</a>.
