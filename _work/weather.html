      <p>This applet displays accurate weather conditions for the user's locale, provided by the OpenWeatherMap API. It does so by acquiring the user's IP, then his location, and then submitting an API request to OpenWeatherMap.org for that location. It's only "fake" in the sense that it's not an installable widget&mdash;it resides only on this page, and can't be installed elsewhere.</p>

    <h3>About this app</h3>
    <p>This app shows the local time and weather conditions. It updates the time every minute, and the weather every 10 minutes. Weather information comes from the <a href="http://openweathermap.org/" target="blank" title="Go to OpenWeatherMap.org">OpenWeatherMap.org</a> API.</p>
    <p>The API request to OpenWeatherMap includes the user's geolocation, which is derived from his IP. The IP is retrieved using the free version of jsonip, offered through <a href="http://getjsonip.com/" target="_blank" title="Visit GetJSONIP.com">GetJSONIP.com</a>. The user's IP is then sent in an API request to <a href="http://freegeoip.net/" target="_blank" title="Read the docs for freegeoip.net">freegeoip.net</a>, which returns his geolocation, in latitude and longitude. This information is then sent with the API request to OpenWeatherMap.org.</p>
    <p>The background is selected from a set of prepared CSS3 gradients, based on the time of day as well as current cloud cover information provided by OpenWeatherMap.org.</p>
    <p>All icons used in Weather Widget are provided by <a href="https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/" target="_blank" title="Go to Weather Icons">Weather Icons</a>, a free icon font library maintained by Eric Flowers as a repository on GitHub.</p>
    <p>The widget's "draggable" feature is implemented with basic jQuery, without needing any additional libraries such as jQuery UI.</p>
