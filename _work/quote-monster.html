    <h3>About QuoteMonster</h3>
    <p>The aim of this project was to produce a simple app that drew JSON data from a remote API, displayed it without a page refresh, and gave users the option to easily tweet the content. The app relies on jQuery, AJAX, a programming quotes API, and the Twitter Developers Documentation to achieve these objectives.</p>
    <p>I used the free <a href="http://quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/api" title="Read the docs for the Programming Quotes API" target="_blank">Programming Quotes API by Storm Consultancy</a> to provide the quotations for this app. Although the API serves up the quotes in several different ways, I chose to take single quotes at random for this app. Before displaying the quotes, I converted all quotation marks into single opening and closing quotes, so they would be correct inside the double-quotes built into the quote box.</p>
    <p>To build the Tweet window, I followed <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/web/tweet-button" title="Read the docs to make a Tweet button" target="_blank">Twitter's developer docs</a> to create a button that sends a request to Twitter.com to open a Tweet window pre-loaded with the quotation and its author. Due to Twitter's famous 140-character limit, the app checks the length of the quotation before attempting to tweet it. Also, because Twitter expects data to arrive in a query parameter, I had to replace certain special characters ("<strong>+</strong>" and "<strong>;</strong>", for example) with escape codes recognized by HTTP.</p>
