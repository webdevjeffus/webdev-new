<p>I originally wrote this blog post while attending <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a>, an immersive web-development program in New York City, during the fall and winter of 2015-2016. DBC views technical blogging as an important activity in a developer's learning process. As such, technical blogging was a part of Dev Bootcamp's curriculum during its nine-week remote preparatory phase, called "Phase 0."</p>

<p>The topics we wrote about were pretty basic, but the information they contain is sound, and might be useful to new developers. They also show what we were thinking and learning about as we began our web development journey.</p>
